# Angular sample project

## This is a small sample project in Angular 4.

Once you have pulled the code, you can run 'ng serve or npm start' to run your server for development.  

You gonna find some small components in the src/app folder. You can easily implement a new one by following this structure.

The home page is displaying a template file with a page title only.

If you click on the list thumbs link, you will get a list of an array. This is defined in the JS and displaying texts and images.

If you click on github, you gonna get a button there. This button is sending a request to the github API and collecting some data from their server.

## So what do we have here?

- sample for routing in Angular
- sample for displaying elements of an array
- sample of calling an API

Good luck for the first steps. If you need any help feel free to contact me on dogiweb@gmail.com.
